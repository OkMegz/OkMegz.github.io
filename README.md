Hi.  
I'm Megan.  
Yes, I don't know too much about web development, but I'm here building and learning as I go. This "portfolio" is my experiment in creating a website and learning about web development. It is ever changing, and I'm always learning and improving. I'm excited to see where this journey takes.

I started with the basics of adding the skeleton - HTML.  
I then added CSS to style the page. I'm still learning about CSS, but I'm having fun experimenting with different styles and layouts.  
I'm also learning about javascript and seeing how it can be used to add interactivity to the page. I'm still in the early stages.  
Hopefully soon I'll be moving on to React.

Enough about that! What about me?  
I'm an aspiring software developer and student. I'm currently studying at the University of South Africa, towards a science degree in Computer Science and Information Systems.
